# GreatHost Documentation

Welcome to the official repository for GreatHost documentation. This project houses all the guides, tutorials, and reference materials for GreatHost services (VPS, Game Servers, IDEs, etc.).

We believe in the power of community. This documentation is open-source, and we encourage you to contribute, improve, and expand it!

## How It Works

Our documentation is built using simple **Markdown** files organized by category. The system automatically reads these files and renders them as web pages.

- **Categories**: Each folder in the `docs/` directory represents a main category (e.g., `VPS`, `GameServer`).
- **Pages**: Each `.md` file inside a category folder becomes a page in the documentation.

The structure looks like this:

```text
docs/
├── VPS/
│   ├── introduction.md
│   └── setup-guide.md
├── GameServer/
│   ├── 1. introduction.md
│   └── 2. console.md
└── ...
```

## How to Contribute

We welcome all contributions! Whether it's fixing a typo, updating outdated information, or writing a brand new guide.

### 2. Creating a New Page

1.  Choose the appropriate category folder in `docs/` (or propose a new one).

    -   *Tip: You can number your files (e.g., `1. setup.md`) to control the order they appear.*
3.  Write your content.
    -   The first line should be the title: `# Your Page Title`

## Markdown Tips

-   **Headings**: `# Title`, `## Section`, `### Subsection`
-   **Bold**: `**text**`
-   **Italic**: `*text*`
-   **Lists**: Use `-` for bullet points or `1.` for numbered lists.
-   **Code**: Use backticks \` for inline code or triple backticks \`\`\` for code blocks.
-   **Links**: `[Link Text](URL)`
