# 💻 GreatHost IDE Guide

## What is GreatHost IDE?
**GreatHost IDE** is a revolutionary cloud-based development environment designed specifically for game server management and web projects. Unlike traditional file managers that only allow basic editing, our IDE provides a full-featured coding experience directly in your web browser.

## Why use a Cloud IDE?
With GreatHost IDE, you don't need to install complex software like VS Code, set up FTP clients, or manage local development environments. Everything runs in the cloud, giving you:

*   **Instant Access**: Code from any device, anywhere in the world.
*   **Zero Setup**: Your environment is pre-configured and ready to go.
*   **Security**: Your code lives on our secure servers; no need to download sensitive files to your local machine.
*   **Real-time Collaboration**: (If applicable) Work on your projects without syncing files manually.

## Key Capabilities
*   **Intelligent Code Editing**: Syntax highlighting, auto-completion, and error detection for popular languages.
*   **Agentic AI Partner**: A built-in AI assistant that understands your project context, writes code, fixes bugs, and helps you build complex features.
*   **Integrated Terminal**: Run commands, install packages, and manage your server directly from the interface.
*   **Seamless File Management**: Upload, organize, and manage your project assets with ease.

## Who is it for?
Whether you are a server owner tweaking configuration files, a developer building custom plugins, or a student learning to code, GreatHost IDE provides the tools you need to succeed without the technical overhead of local setups.
