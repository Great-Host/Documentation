# 🎛️ IDE Interface & Usage

## The Code Editor
The core of the GreatHost IDE is a robust code editor that supports syntax highlighting for multiple languages (JavaScript, Python, YAML, JSON, etc.). It is designed to be familiar to developers who use tools like VS Code.

### Key Components
- **File Explorer**: On the left sidebar, navigate through your server's directory structure.
- **Editor Area**: Open multiple files simultaneously using tabs.
- **Status Bar**: View cursor position, language mode, and other contextual information.
- **Shortcuts**: Use standard shortcuts like `Ctrl+S` (or `Cmd+S` on Mac) to save your work instantly.

## AI Assistant 🤖
One of the most powerful features of the GreatHost IDE is the built-in **Agentic AI**. This isn't just a chatbot; it's a coding partner capable of understanding your project context.

### What can the AI do?
- **Code Generation**: Ask the AI to write entire functions, classes, or scripts from scratch.
- **Project Creation**: The AI can help scaffold full projects, setting up dependencies and file structures.
- **Error Debugging**: Paste an error log, and the AI will analyze it and suggest fixes.
- **Context Awareness**: The AI is aware of your current file and project structure, so it can give specific advice.

### How to use it:
1.  Click the **AI Button** (usually in the bottom right or top bar).
2.  Type your request in natural language (e.g., "Create a simple Express.js server" or "Fix the syntax error in line 45").
3.  Watch as the AI generates code and explanations in real-time.

## File Management
Managing your project files is seamless within the IDE, allowing you to create and upload content without external tools.

### Uploading Files
To bring existing files into your project:
1.  Click the **Upload** icon in the file explorer toolbar.
2.  Drag and drop your files into the modal, or click to select them from your computer.
3.  Files will be uploaded to the current directory immediately.
