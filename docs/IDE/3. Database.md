# 🗄️ Database Management

## Overview
Just like the Game Server panel, the IDE includes a dedicated **Database** tab for managing MySQL databases. This is essential for web applications, bots, or any project that needs to store structured data.

## Creating a Database
To set up a new database for your project:
1.  Navigate to the **Database** tab.
2.  Click the **New Database** button.
3.  Enter a name for your database.
4.  Click **Create**.

## Connection Details
To connect your application to the database, you'll need the specific credentials. Click on the database name or the eye icon to view them.

You will see:
- **Host**: The server address.
- **Port**: The port number (usually `3306`).
- **Database**: The full name of your database.
- **Username**: Your assigned username.
- **Password**: The secure password for access.
- **Remote**: The connection string for remote access (if allowed).

> **Tip:** You can copy these details and paste them directly into your project's configuration files (like `.env` or `config.json`).
