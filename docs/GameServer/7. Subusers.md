# 👥 Subusers Guide

## Overview
The **Subusers** tab allows you to give other people access to manage your server. This is perfect for server staff, developers, or friends who help you run the server. You can control exactly what permissions each user has.

3.  **Username/Email**: Enter the email address of the user you want to add. They must have a registered account on the panel.
4.  **Permissions**: Select the specific permissions you want to grant. You can check "Grant Full Access" to give them control over everything, or select individual permissions for Console, Files, Backups, etc.
5.  Click **Add Subuser** to confirm.

## Managing Subusers
Once a user is added, you can modify their access at any time:
- **Edit Permissions**: Click on the pencil icon to change what they can do.
- **Remove Access**: Click the trash icon to revoke their access to your server completely.

> **Security Tip:** Only give users the permissions they absolutely need. For example, a moderator might only need access to the Console, while a developer might need access to Files and SFTP.
