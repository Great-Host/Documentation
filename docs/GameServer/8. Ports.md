# 🌐 Ports & Network Guide

## Overview
The **Ports** tab (sometimes labeled "Network") allows you to manage the network ports assigned to your server. Every server comes with a primary port, but you may need additional ports for plugins (like Dynmap, Votifier, or voice chat).

## Allocating a New Port
If you need an extra port for a plugin:
1.  Click the **Assign Port** button.
2.  A confirmation modal will appear.

3.  The system will automatically find an available port for you.
4.  Click **Assign** to confirm.

## Managing Allocations
Once a port is assigned, you can:
- **Primary**: Set which port is the main connection point for players joining your server.
- **Notes**: Add a note to remember what each port is used for (e.g., "Dynmap", "Voice Chat").
- **Unassign**: If you no longer need a port, you can remove it to free up resources.

> **Tip:** Make sure to configure your plugin to use the exact port number you have been assigned here. Using a port not listed in this tab will not work.
