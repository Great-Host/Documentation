# 🖥️ Server Console Guide

## Overview
The console is the central hub for managing your game server. From here, you can monitor performance, control the server's state, view live logs, and execute commands directly.

## Resource Monitoring
At the top of the console page, you can see real-time statistics about your server's performance:
- **CPU Usage**: Current processor load percentage.
- **Memory Usage**: Amount of RAM currently being used.
- **Disk Space**: Storage space consumed by your server files.
- **Network**: Current network traffic speed.

## Power Actions
Control your server's lifecycle with the dedicated power buttons:
- **Start**: Power on the server.
- **Restart**: Reboot the server to apply changes or refresh resources.
- **Stop**: Gracefully shut down the server.
- **Kill**: Forcefully terminate the server process (use only if the server is unresponsive).

## Live Console & Commands
The main area displays the server's log output in real-time.
- **Colored Output**: The console supports syntax highlighting, making it easy to distinguish between info, warnings, and errors.
- **Command Execution**: You can type commands in the input field at the bottom to interact with the server directly.

## AI Assistant
