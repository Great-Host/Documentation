# 🛡️ Backups Guide

## Overview
The **Backups** tab allows you to create and manage backups of your server. Regular backups are essential to protect your data against accidental deletions, corruption, or griefing.

## Creating a Backup
To create a new backup of your server:
1.  Click the **New Backup** button in the top right corner.
2.  (Optional) Give your backup a name to easily identify it later.
3.  Wait for the process to complete. The backup will appear in the list with its size and creation date.

> **Note:** The server may experience a slight performance drop while the backup is being created, depending on the size of your files.

## Restoring a Backup
If you need to revert your server to a previous state:
1.  Find the backup you want to restore in the list.
2.  Click the **Restore** icon (usually a counter-clockwise arrow).
3.  A confirmation modal will appear.

### Important Warnings
- **Server Stop**: Your server will be stopped automatically if it is running.
- **Data Loss**: All current files will be deleted and replaced with the backup content. **This action cannot be undone.**

### Confirmation
To confirm the restoration:
1.  Check the box **"Delete all existing files before restoring (Recommended)"** to ensure a clean restore.
2.  Type **RESTORE** in the text field to confirm your intent.
3.  Click the red **Restore Backup** button.

## Other Actions
- **Download**: You can download a backup to your local computer for safe keeping.
- **Lock**: Lock a backup to prevent it from being automatically deleted (if you have a backup limit).
- **Delete**: Remove old backups to free up space.
