# 🗄️ Database Guide

## Overview
The **Database** tab allows you to create and manage MySQL databases for your server. Many plugins and mods require a database to store player data, permissions, or game logs efficiently.

## Creating a Database
To set up a new database:
1.  Click the **New Database** button.
2.  Enter a name for your database (e.g., `s319_test`).
3.  Click **Create Database**.
4.  Your new database will appear in the list with its connection details.

## Connection Details
To connect your plugins or external tools to the database, you need the specific connection information. Click the **Eye icon** or the database name to view these details.

You will see the following fields:
- **Host**: The address of the database server (e.g., `forward.greathost.es`).
- **Port**: The port number (usually `3306`).
- **Database**: The full name of your database.
- **Username**: The username assigned to your database.
- **Password**: Click the eye icon to reveal or copy the password.

> **Note:** If you need to change the password, look for a "Rotate Password" or "Reset Password" button within the database options.

## Deleting a Database
If you no longer need a database:
1.  Find the database in the list.
2.  Click the **Trash/Delete icon**.
3.  Confirm the deletion. **Warning:** This will permanently remove all data stored in that database.
