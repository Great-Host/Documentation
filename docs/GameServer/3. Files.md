# 📂 File Manager Guide

## Overview
The **Files** tab gives you direct access to your server's file system. You can upload, edit, and manage all your server files directly from your browser without needing an external FTP client.

## Uploading Files
Getting your files onto the server is easy:
- **Drag & Drop**: Simply drag files from your computer and drop them anywhere in the file list area to start uploading immediately.
- **Upload Button**: Click the upload icon (usually an arrow pointing up or a "Upload" button) to select files from your device.

## Creating Content
You can create new content directly:
- **New File**: Create a blank file (like `server.properties` or `config.yml`) and edit it instantly.
- **New Directory**: Create folders to keep your server organized.

## Managing Files
Click on a file to open the **Web Editor**, or use the action menu (three dots or right-click) for more options:
- **Edit**: Modify configuration files with syntax highlighting.
- **Rename**: Change the name of any file or folder.
- **Move**: Transfer files to different directories.
- **Delete**: Permanently remove files you no longer need.
- **Download**: Save a copy of the file to your local computer.
- **Unarchive**: Extract `.zip`, `.tar`, or `.rar` files directly on the server.
